# Type Safety Guidelines

- Do not use any. If necessary, use unknown or create specific types/interfaces.
- Prefer type annotation over type assertion; limit the use of assertions only when unavoidable.
- Reduce redundant or repetitive code after generation.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Use consistent naming conventions.
- TypeScript strict mode.
- Single quotes, no semicolons.
- Use functional patterns where possible.
- Validate inputs or controller using schema-based validation (Zod).
